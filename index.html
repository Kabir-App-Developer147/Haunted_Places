                <h2>1. The Tower of London</h2>
                <p class="location">London, England</p>
                <p>For nearly 1,000 years, this fortress has been a site of torture, execution, and imprisonment. The ghost of Anne Boleyn, beheaded by Henry VIII, is said to walk the corridors carrying her severed head. Guards have reported seeing her ghostly figure multiple times, and some have fled their posts in terror.</p>

                <p>Known as the "Suicide Forest," this dense woodland at the base of Mount Fuji is Japan's most infamous location. Visitors report compasses malfunctioning, an eerie silence, and the overwhelming feeling of being watched. Many claim to hear whispers and see shadows moving between the trees.</p>

                <p>This crumbling prison once held America's most notorious criminals in complete isolation. Inmates went insane from the solitude, and many died within its walls.

                <p>Legally prohibited to visit after sunset by the Indian government, this cursed fort is said to be haunted by the spirit of a sorcerer.

                <p>Used as a quarantine station for plague victims and later as a mental asylum, over 160,000 people died on this island.

                <p>The tallest castle in France is home to "La Dame Verte" (The Green Lady), the ghost of Charlotte de Brézé, murdered by her husband after he discovered her affair. Guests hear her moaning in the tower room and have seen her ghastly face with hollow eyes peering from windows.</p>

                <p>Thousands of mutilated dolls hang from trees on this island, placed by a man haunted by the spirit of a drowned girl. After his death, locals say the dolls come alive at night, moving their heads and opening their eyes. Their whispers can be heard in the darkness.</p>

                <p>Six million skeletons line the walls of these underground tunnels. Visitors who venture into the illegal sections often become lost, never to be seen again.
